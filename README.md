# ESP32C6 Super blink
Blink program for Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6, using Arduino and Platformio

The idea is to extend the program in due time with WiFi web app and other features, to test the Tasmota framework

Need to use the Tasmota platform, because the regular Platformio does not support newer Arduino versions.
Latest IDF 5.1.4 based Tasmota platform for ESP32 can be found on the Releases page of:
